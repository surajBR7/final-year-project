                                FINAL YEAR PROJECT
                                    Abstract   

A banking chatbot project is built using Artificial Intelligence algorithms that analyze the
users queries and understand the users message. The system is designed for banks to
use where users can ask any bank related questions like loan, account, policy, etc. This
application is developed for devices that have internet connectivity. The system
recognizes the users query and understands what he wants to convey and
simultaneously answers them appropriately. At present, there are chat applications for
banks. The questions asked by the users can be in any format. There is no specific
format for users to ask questions. The built-in artificial intelligence system realizes
users requirements and provides suitable answers to the user. These voice bots can be
built from scratch or they can be deployed on existing chat-bots by enabling then with
voice services. It also uses a graphical representation (if necessary) of a person
speaking while giving answers as a real person would do as an employee. Bank chatbot
solves the issues a user has and clarifies it with its knowledge.

In banks, at the customer care service and enquiry desks, humans are insufficient and
usually takes long time to process a single request which results in wastage of time and
also reduce the quality of customer service.

The primary goal of this chatbot is the customer can interact with their queries in plain
English and the chat bot can resolve their queries with appropriate response in return.
The proposed system sends notifications to customers, provide balance information,
suggest how to save money, provide credit report updates and help customers with
simple transactions. This project demonstrates the architecture and methodology used
for developing such chat bot.


                                    INTRODUCTION

Chatbots can conduct smart and compelling conversations on behalf of the bank with
millions of consumers at a fraction of the cost. They promise to enhance the bank’s
customer’s experience and their approachability. Natural language processing which
can be lumped in with artificial intelligence, allows a chatbot application to understand
human speech or text messages, including discerning intent.

Banks play an important role in the economy for everyday life and for offering finance to
businesses who wish to invest and expand. In day-to-day life, everybody needs banks.
But most of the people, especially the first-timers, struggle to know various procedures
and processes required to get their work done at the bank and avail of its different
products and services.

This banking chatbot project is built using various artificial algorithms that analyses
user’s queries and responds appropriately. We are going to design system for bank
websites where users can ask any bank related questions like loan, account, policy etc.
This application will be developed for web users. The system will recognize user’s queryand understands what he wants to convey and simultaneously answers them appropriately. Even if the user does not frame sentence properly system will understand the query and answer accordingly. There is no specific format the user must follow to ask questions. 

The built-in artificial intelligence system realizes users requirements and
provides suitable answers to the user. This system would be a huge advantage in
having place an intelligent query handling program which could in next phases not just
respond but self-learn to improve itself thereby increasing not just the quality of
customer service but also reducing human load, increase in productivity and of course
increasing number of satisfied customer

                                    LITERATURE SURVEY

[2020] Banking ChatBot using Artificial Intelligence, Prof.Bavithra M, Indhu C
In this research paper, according to input, the intelligent system will process the query and give
responses to the user.By introducing an artificial brain, the web-based bot generates customized
user responses according to the user. Questions asked to the chatbot will not be understood,
hence will be processed by a third party expert system providing better results. In the system that
is proposed the user can search the bank details using an android application. In this system users
can search the details of multiple banks. This helps the user to know the entire details of the bank
regarding loan, account, and so on. Users can select the bank and know the entire details about
that bank. They dont need to enquire about their friends or the bank employees. Thus, the
proposed system helps the user to know the details about the bank details which are needed. Also
to enable the users workspace to have additional functionalities that are not provided under a
conventional banking project.

[2019] Customer’s Attitude towards Chatbots in Banking Industry of India, Amisha Gupta,
Deepti Sharma
Gone are the days where people have to stand in queues to avail the banking services. Artificial
Intelligence is dramatically changing the world. It is leading to better experience and assistance
to the customer. As a result marketers understand the importance of those applications which
helps in conversing with the customers and helps in providing better assistance. ChatBots have
begun to mark their presence in the Indian Banking sector. Kotak Mahindra Bank is the first to
ever launch the voice chatbot named “Keya”. Bank of Baroda has also deployed ChatBot to
handle consumer queries. ChatBots can analyse and understand not only the content but also the
context of the customer’s questions. Chatbots can analyse and understand not only the content
but also the context of the customer’s questions. As the research topic involves Banking chatbots
as an artificially conversational agent which is enough intelligent to initiate and simulate human-
like conversation.

[2020] The Use of Voice Input to Induce Human Communication with Banking Chatbots,
Prof.Sonoghyun Kim, Prof.Soojin Jun
The use of chatbots is more common in our everyday lives than ever before. However, few
studies have been conducted comparing the differences between text- and voice-input modalities
of chatbots in the banking industry. In this study, through empirical and survey-based research,
users were shown to rate their relationships with the banking chatbots as more helpful and self-
validating when they communicate with it by a voice-input modality than by a text-input
modality.

[2019] ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING MILLENNIAL’S TECHNOLOGY
ACCEPTANCE OF CHATBOT IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY IN INDONESIA;
RichadRichad, VivensiusVivensius, SfenriantoSfenrianto and Emil R. Kaburuan
The purpose of this research is to analyze factors that influence millennial’s technology
acceptance of chatbot in the banking industry in Indonesia. In this quantitative research,
innovativeness is the exogenous variable, while the endogenous variables are perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using and behavioral intention. This research
used primary data gathered from distributed questionnaires, directly from the millennial people
in Indonesia. Using simple random sampling technique to total sample of 400 people out of the
total population of 90 million people. Statistical analysis in this research is conducted using
Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS–SEM). The result shows that
innovativeness, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude towards using the
chatbot affected behavioral intention.

                                    PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed system is Banking bot is an artificial intelligent develop for banking
operations, who understand people queries and responds accordingly. The main aim of
this project is to develop a banking bot using artificial intelligent algorithms which should
be able to analyze and understand user’s queries and react accordingly. For
any banking related queries we have to go to the bank or call to customer care. It takes
lot of time and effort and bank people are also very busy to attend our queries. On the
other hand, we don’t get complete information from the customer care executives. It will
be more suitable if we can directly post our queries online or chat with the bank people
and get the response with no time. To overcome this problem, we proposed banking bot
where people can directly chat with the bot.
This system includes the following modules:

1. Create user information repository - In this module we use banking system to
collect basic information about account holders like account holder name, account number, address, etc.
and some of the transaction’s details like credit and debit. In this module use first
register the detail information into the system then admin will verify the
information and then it authorizes the user id then user will successfully log into
the system.

2. User Input Module - In user input module we develop the application and in
application account holders will have to login by entering their account number
and password details, after the successful login user will enter the question in
form of text voice.

3. Question Processing Module - If the user uses voice input formats then this
module converts the voice to text format and then it will pass to query interpreter.
The query interpreters will interpret the input query using NLP (Natural Language
Processing) and NLP will convert the query into specific format, removing of stop
words and so on.

4. Answer Generation Module - The meaningful word of question we take from
question processing module and it will be send to server then server will match
the appropriate patterns from repositories and after the matching the answer will
be send to the user into proper format. After receiving question from users
system will process by AIML (artificial intelligence markup language) that
question and will provide answer to user. Here system will use data provided by
banking system and data provided by administrator.
                                        
                                        SOFTWARE INTERFACE

1. FRONT END AND BACK END: The front end is designed using React framework which
includes a collaborative platform for bot creating, hosting and deploying. React is the
collaborative end to end bot platform made by developers for the developers. Here all the bot
tools are integrated and it allows automatic detection of entities. It uses NLP, Machine Learning.
API Connectivity is been done using PHP.

2. PHP: PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and
interactive Web pages. PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such
as Microsofts ASP.PHP is an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a widely-used, open
source scripting language. PHP scripts are executed on the server.

3. MACHINE LEARNING: Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it
enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed.
When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and
develop by themselves.

4.NLP: Natural-language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial
intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural)languages,
in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language
data.

5. MY SQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).The
MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was
owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned
by Oracle Corporation For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer
additional functionality. MySQL is a central component of the LAMP open-source web
application software stack (and other AMP stacks). LAMP is an acronym for Linux, Apache,
MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. Applications that use the MySQL database include: TYPO3,
MODx, Joomla, WordPress, Simple Machines Forum, phpBB, MyBB, and Drupal.

6. JSON: JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring
data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative
to XML. The two primary parts that make up JSON are keys and values. Together they make a
key/value
